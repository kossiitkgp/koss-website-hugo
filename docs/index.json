However, due the misuse of the above flexibility, the print statement was changed into a function, and thus restricting the misuse of the above said advantage. **Integer division **: The integer division in python2 takes two numbers, and returns the integer portion, as it discards the decimal part. This was certainly not obvious, as 3/2 should return 1.5 and not 1. Python 3 ensured that the integer division returns values in float, rather than int.

From Git’s official website:\nGit is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\nAbout Version Control\nWhat is version control, and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Even though examples in most of the cases show software source code as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer can be placed under version control.\nTo install Git:\nsudo apt-get install git\nTo check version:\ngit -- version\nFor configuring:\ngit config -- global \u0026lt;keyword\u0026gt; “Data”\n \u0026lt;keyword\u0026gt; can be user.name ,user.email, core.editor etc. To display current saved configration type git config --list  For help:\ngit help \u0026lt;verb\u0026gt;\neg: git help configfor help regarding configration process\nCreating a local repository:\n Simply cd into the directory you want to track and simply type git init. This will create a .git file in the directory with a basic skeleton without any commits.  To check which files can be commited:\ngit status\nthis will list the files that can be commited\n To ignore files create a .gitignore file using touch .gitignore Open this using text editor and add names of files you want to ignore  Moving files to staging area:\n For adding files individually use –git add \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; For adding all files at once use –git add -A To remove files from staging area use –git reset \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;and to remove all simply type git reset  To commit the files:\ngit commit\nbut it is necessary to add messages with the commit to make sure what we did ; so for that we use -m extension like git commit -m “message”\nStaging and committing Flowchart.\nTo check the commit history:\ngit log\nCloning a repository from internet:\ngit clone \u0026lt;url\u0026gt; \u0026lt;location\u0026gt;\n To clone into current directory use .in place of location. To check status of the cloned repository use git remote -v This will give the location from where it is fetched. git branch -a gives all the branches in the cloned repository.  Changing and submitting:\n Make changes to the file of the cloned repository.Now to see change made type git diff \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt;  This will display the change made with respect to the\u0026lt;commit\u0026gt;. By default if \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; field is left empty , Git compares it withHEAD i.e the last commit.\n Another feature or form of git diff is\ngit diff --cached \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt;\nThis shows the diff between your **staged changes **and the . So, here it gives the diff between your index and the last commit.\ngit diff \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; shows the diff between the *current ***working tree **and the .\n  Now git statuswill view the modified files . Add the file to the staging area using git add -A. Commit these files with appropriate message . Now before pushing it back . We need to pull and check whether any other person made a change in the branch since the last time type in git pull origin master ( If on master branch else use branch name in place of master).   IMPORTANT NOTE:\ngit pull is often confused with git fetch .The basic difference is stated below.\ngit fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository — but it doesn’t integrate any of this new data into your working files. Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.\nDue to it’s “harmless” nature, you can rest assured: fetch will never manipulate, destroy, or screw up anything.git fetch* is also useful when we manually wish to merge or check and merge conflicts that arise whereas git pull directly fetches and merges (refer branching for merge). It is therefore more preferred to use git fetch .*\ngit pull in contrast, is used with a different goal in mind: to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. This means that pull not only downloads new data; it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.\n Now for finally pushing type in –\u0026gt;\ngit push origin master\nBasic process Flowchart.\nBranching:\nA typical image which represents blue dots as master and rest as side branches.\n To create a new branch use git branch \u0026lt;branchname\u0026gt; To check all the branches present use git branch To switch over branch use git checkout \u0026lt;branchname\u0026gt; To push a commited changes type in git push -u origin \u0026lt;branchname\u0026gt; To merge the current branch you are working on to master use git merge \u0026lt;branchname\u0026gt; To push the changes we simply use git push origin master To check it they are merged type in git branch --merged If the branch is successfully merged we can now delete the branch–git branch -d \u0026lt;branchname\u0026gt;  To switch to a previous version of the code:\nWe do git reset \u0026lt;mode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SOME-COMMIT\u0026gt;(some commit is the commit number ) then Git will:\n Make your current branch (typically master) back to point at \u0026lt;SOME-COMMIT\u0026gt;. Then it will modify your working tree and the index (“staging area”) according to the \u0026lt;mode\u0026gt; selected. The mode must be one of the following (If \u0026lt;mode\u0026gt; is left blank then by default --mixed is selected) — --soft—Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to\u0026lt;SOME-COMMIT\u0026gt;, just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed files “Changes to be committed”, as git status would put it. --mixed— Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e. the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated. This is the default action. --hard— Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since \u0026lt;SOME-COMMIT\u0026gt; are discarded.  Stashing\nOften there is a condition where code is in a messy state and you don’t want to work any further . Also you can’t commit this half-written code. In such conditions function called git stash is used.\n Type in git stash this will push this code onto a stack while keeping the working directory clean.Further use of this function again and again on the same code will generate a stash stack. To display the stash stack use git stash list .The list will be numbered as stash@{0},stash@{1} ….stash@{n} . Finally when you decide to work again and want to apply the changes use git stash apply . To apply any older stash from the stash stack use git stash apply stash@{n} where n is the stash number.

Though I already know the basics of command line but just in case I was missing something, I thought to go through it once.\nhttps://in.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595\nThis course is for a beginner. It’s not preferred to go through it, if you already know about the commands. But I have mentioned the brief summary of it and key points which I didn’t know.\nIn the start of the course, I found something really fascinating, how to set up a virtual machine on my own computer. It made me feel really good that I can set up a new computer on my own system. Sounds interesting, right? Why Virtual Machine? This link will tell you the reasons why people prefer to use the virtual machine for their work.\nSo in this blog, I will mention all those things which I learnt something new today.\n To set up the virtual machine, follow the above link. In the first few slides, you will be carried through the instructions how to set the virtual environment up. I wont mention that here. cat \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt; will display the content of the file on the terminal itself. man \u0026lt;command_name\u0026gt; for eg: man apt will give you the manual pages (detailed help) of the command apt. you can look through it in case of a doubt. Note: Many commands also have a -h flag which shows help. man shows a “detailed version” of the help. Line based commands: There some commands which when typed doesn’t return back the cursor, eg: bc (used to access the calculator). You got to type quit or Ctrl+D for exiting from that interface. There is a command less \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt; which is used to access a text file page wise rather than using cat \u0026lt;file_name\u0026gt; which displays the whole text. This is especially useful when dealing with long texts.  Relative Path v/s Absolute Path\n cd without arguments is a shortcut to take you to your home directory.\n mkdir is used to make a directory (You all must be knowing that). But rmdiris used to remove an empty directory (Note empty). If you wish to remove a directory with files in it, you will have to do that recursively using rm -r \u0026lt;directory name\u0026gt;.\n ls is used to list all the files in the current directory. ls -a will list all the hidden and non-hidden files in the directory and ls -al will give all the details of the files. Here -a and -al are called the flags.\n touch will create an empty file in the current directory.\n cp copies the file in the required directory. Syntax is like cp test.txt Downloads . Here the second word is the destination folder. cp -r docs more_docs copies the content of of docs to more_docs. Note the -r flag standing for recursive.\n date gives the current date.\n  So to wrap up, using the virtual machine really amazed me. Using it, I can store files hidden, in case needed. I even learnt about some new commands of the command line.\nKeep learning!

To all esteemed student who are trying to pursue their dreams irrespective of their departments and previous experience.\nEveryone is welcome. Here “Everyone” is not a metaphor, “Everyone” means everyone.\nOpen source is not just “GSoC”. It is a lot about, idea, ego, altruism, expression and satisfaction. From software to hardware to information anything can be opensource. We do open-source because we love to. “GSoC” is just a good motivation to start.\nSome famous open source projects:\nFirefox, Linux, Ubuntu, VLC.\nNow coming back to KWoC, common problems faced and how to be prepared.\nPsychological Barriers :- Completing KWoC requires you to overcome a statement “I have just started with coding” or “These are State of Art things,It requires a lot of experience”. I will easily term these statements as myths or excuse.\nWhy these thoughts arise?\nFrom project info. You will read fancy terms as “Scraping” “Audio-recognition” “Natural Language Processing” “Deep Learning” “Networking” and you will lose your heart. But the matter of truth is that project info tells you just about what that project really does, not about the process how it performs that task. In most of the projects mentioned, you are not going to implement everything yourself and you don’t need to read everything present in the codebase. There are pre-implemented library for most of state of art things, you just need to learn some basic info about how to use these libraries.\nMost of the software development is based on basic conditional statements, libraries and lot of common sense.\nMentor Problem:- A lot of time there is a problem in response of mentor. A lot of time mentor doesn’t respond in a helpful way or doesn’t respond at all. Let me tell you a ravishing truth “This phenomenon happens in GSoC as well”. Really you can’t help. Now what, you are in shoes of Robert frost, “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both”, either you can become hopeless again and take a road more traveled or you can make it a memorable event where you overcame your mediocrity. Try some other project with similar portfolio. The cycle is shortlist project, talk to mentor, if you find him convincing or if you think you can do project without his guidance then only proceed, then code debug and repeat.Bug co-ordinator, but mark my word if you are bugging anyone it’s your responsibility to respect his/her time, give back your effort or remember that “Karma is a bitch”.\nUbuntu:-If you are new to ubuntu, “KWOC is going to be really awesome” . Because you will remember this winter for like 1–2 years, because if you are high on grit you will be going through a lot of learning shit. Okay, Siri is here to your rescue, Ubuntu is nothing like Windows but considering you as a Windows user, Instead of .exe there are other methods to install applications.\nHere is some Chinese wisdom for you my friend.\nThere is terminal in ubuntu (ctrl + alt + t). Here is an important [link]** to make you little aware of terminal. Get aware of this blog, terminal is quite important for software development. Here is the [[chest]](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=801404) of all beginner friendly links.How to install software and libraries[link]**. You don’t need to learn everything at one go. As you start coding and setting up environment for your respective project refer to these link as per need. If you have not installed Ubuntu then visit this [link].\nGit:- A command line tool to save different versions of your code wrt to changes. Nothing more or less than that. People have complicated this unnecessarily. It also interacts with Github and Bitbucket.\nOne of the best places to learn git is Learn Git Branching\nStarter pack of git :-\na) If you have installed Ubuntu very recently then for installation of git\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install git  b) When you use git for the first time, you’ll have to configure it with details matching with your GitHub profile.\ngit config — global user.name “ ” git config — global user.email “ ”  c) If you are behind a proxy server then to configure git to access Github.\ngit config — global http.proxy 172.16.2.30:8080  d) Then login in your Github account.\nThis is just a sample. Change URL according to your project. Don’t just blindly copy paste. Read instruction properly.\ne) Visit this link Kossiitkgp website repo [Visit your respective project link].\nf) On top right of that window click on watch button and pick watching option\ng) Beside that button is star, star it as well, then there is fork button, click on fork button.\nh) Then you will be automatically directed to your forked window.\nk) Click on that green button of clone or download.\nl) When you click there, a menu appears where there is an option to copy link but ensure that you copy the link is in this format\nAnd not in this format:\nm) Then press ctrl+alt+t\nn)Then enter in terminal “git clone ” and then press ctrl+shift + v and then hit enter (hitting enter is an untold rule).\ngit clone  o) cd kossiitkgp.github.io [change according to name of your project]\np) Then enter in terminal git remote add upstream and then press ctrl+shift+v\ngit checkout -b newbranch  r) If you can, edit some files in cloned folder (using git clone)for productive use, save your changes by ctrl + s (if using sublime or gedit etc) .\ns) Then properly review your changes then type this command in terminal in already opened terminal.\ngit add -A git commit -m “ ” git push origin  v) Enter your username and password. While entering password you will not see anything\nw) Done\nx) Then visit https://github.com/your-user-name(plz change)/kossiitkgp.github.io\ny) Then click on pull request then click on create new pr.(Check two branches which you are comparing)\nz) If you are sending pr after few days of cloning then before git push first do\ngit pull  **(there are other methods as well like fetch and rebase) **or face the wrath of merge conflict.\nFor proper crisp tutorial read [this].\nGithub:- It is just a website(like Fb/Orkut) where pull request are similar to Fb’s friend request. It is definitely more productive and useful.\nBut a more complicated definition\n“GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.”\nDefinitely, it gives a lot more insight only if you understand the terminology :) :)\nReading codebase:- My steps would be:\nA)\n1. Setup a source insight( or any good source code browser you use) workspace/project with all the source, header files, in the code base. Browsing at a higher level from the top most function(main) to lowermost function. During this code browsing, keep making notes on a paper/or a word document tracing the flow of the function calls. Do not get into function implementation nitti-gritties in this step, keep that for a later iterations. In this step keep track of what arguments are passed on to functions, return values, how the arguments that are passed to functions are initialized how the value of those arguments set modified, how the return values are used ?\n2. After one iteration of step 1, after which you have some level of understanding of code and data structures used in the code base, setup a…………………..[source]\nB)\n1) Identify why I’m reading code. Could be to understand an algorithm, see different coding style, learn a language, find a defect, figure out a workaround, understand a badly documented feature, know how to extend a feature, make a plugin, discover how to exploit a feature beyond the initial intents, …\n2) Find where to start reading. That could be the main/index file of the application or library, a manifest. Or you could search the code for a documented feature……………….[source]\nGoogling:- Google any error which comes while development.This [URL] is in different context though. But you can get some idea. If you face any problem while development just translate your problem to words and search, if you are not getting solution reframe your problem and then search again. Before asking anyone perform the above instruction at least two times.\nLearning:- Learn what you google. If you are just googling and not learning you are equally dependent as you were before. Here learning refers to mugging.\nLibraries:-This is the basic difference b/w Windows and Ubuntu , In Windows, we install whole everything to do something but in Ubuntu, we install something to do a lot of thing. A minimalistic approach towards development.\nAs one of the member of open-source community, I would like you to introduce to its manifesto\nWe need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that’s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for……….[source]\nCollective intelligence — multinational, multiagency, multidisciplinary, multidomain information-sharing and sense-making — is the only means of obtaining near-real time understanding of complex systems sufficient to achieve resilience in the face of changes. Many of these changes, including biospheric ones such as climate change and depletion of planetary resources, are the result of human activity and industry in the last three centuries.[source]\nIn a more beautiful way\n“Beneath the mask, there is more than flesh, there is an idea and ideas are bulletproof”\nWith Love From:\nKharagpur Open Source Society\nThis article is written by Apoorva Kumar\n","date":1510597800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510597800,"objectID":"803d898903285d6076f32b33294aa4df","permalink":"/blog/informal-introduction-to-kwoc/","publishdate":"2017-11-14T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/blog/informal-introduction-to-kwoc/","section":"blog","summary":"Great People of tomorrow, every perfume starts with one ingredient but it is the last one that makes it come to life.\nHi! and Welcome!

Nevertheless, you should not make this mistake again.\nThis is written with respect to software related READMEs, if you want guidelines for other stuff, then probably this isn’t the right place.\nLet’s discuss the potential problems of not having a good README:\nNot a clear description of the project I don’t recount how many times this has happened with me. I usually just scroll through all of my friends’ projects on GitHub to see what they are upto these days and time and again I have been disappointed by not seeing a good description about the project and it is too time consuming to read the whole source code to find out what that repository is actually doing.\nIn fact some professional projects too have vague description and you are left clueless as to what the code does. Sometimes the project is so big that they can’t really mention all of it in one thing. That is the time you should probably split it in many repositories or folders (if you desperately want a big mono repo like Google) and each folder should contain some high-level information of what the code inside it will do, just like recursive Makefiles.\nNot having a installation guide (or an incomplete one) So since you have got the viewer interested in trying our your software by writing a good introduction, you would now probably piss off her by sucking at writing an installation guide.\nWhat a developer should understand is that since your development environment is setup to run that code, doesn’t mean everybody’s is. One should always write the whole installation process for all systems that the software supports and it should clearly mention that the software doesn’t really have support for this system but it would be great to support it in future or something.\nFor unix-based systems, one should list out all the ways to install the software. Let’s take an example of Ubuntu. If you have managed to get your software packaged with a .deb file and also uploaded it upstream so that it can be used with apt-get, then that’s just awesome!\nSometimes you might be releasing it and then packing the source code in a tar.gz format, still awesome. In the latter case, it would be worth while to mention all of the dependencies required. Also, just the name isn’t enough, their exact version numbers is even better because you might never know when a python code breaks because of the version bump because well that’s how things work in python world.\nIf you are expecting the user to do a gcc based compiling for each source code file then God just forgive you. It is time to move on to at least Makefiles to automate that process for you.\nIf something doesn’t work in particular systems, it is important to list it out.\nNo User Documentation You don’t have a user documentation? Well then how do you expect others to use your software. User documentation should be in another file or folder (if it is quite big) and should probably be in some kind of a format which can be rendered easily. You can either write it in markdown format or in Github wiki’s so that it can be easily read on GitHub or you can write in man pages form for the oldies to read it. But you should have it. And that’s not it, your README should explicitly point out to the documentation and also tell the user how to access it and actually read it.\nAlso you can include the very basic use case in the README itself.\nNo guide for people to actually contribute If you have the viewer till now and she is thinking of actually contributing to your project, then kudos, your project is awesome.\nA very important part of the contributing guide is to setup the development environment. Again in this, it is worthwhile to get into the platform specific information. For eg. Windows will have different development environment while Ubuntu will have a different one. You should mention what IDE you used or the tools that you used.\nNow your project might have some development related dependencies. You should mention about that too. Now finally the viewer can have successful environment setup to actually contribute to your code.\nNow, you might be following some conventions for writing your code, right? It is worth while to mention the conventions that you have followed in a separate file and link it in the README.\nThen you would have a specific way or two in which you accept others’ code, right? You might be using Github’s Pull Request based system or the age old sending patches via email using git-format-patch and git-send-email just like old times. Whichever you prefer, it is important to specify this in a new file possibly named as CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES or something. If you have any specifics about the project mention it there. Don’t just expect people to know it by default.\nIt is also worth while to link the easy to fix bugs for new comers so that they can get familiar with the code base without trying to mingle with the core parts of the software.\nNo technical documentation If you are having a big project, then you might be having a “core” part which is used by other parts of code. Have you documented it? Or you just expect people to git-grep and git-blame to find the relevant use cases, definition of the functions and the documentation inside the commit messages? If you are doing that, it is not exactly bad (I understand you might be having your own reasons) but it is good to write a technical documentation wherein you will tell the programmer what a method does and how to use it. This will also make sure she doesn’t write a method to do the same stuff again and thus it would reduce your redundancy.\nNo mention of how to run tests Of course you project has tests, otherwise how can you make sure that by writing new code, you don’t break the old code? Your README should contain how to run the test suite. There are tons of different test suites available in the market and it is time consuming for people to check out your test framework and make guesses as how one could probably run it. You should mention how to run individual tests, the whole test suite, and how to skip some tests, and if your test suite framework doesn’t support all of these features, then maybe the one you are using should be replaced.\nNo license Yes, legal matters are important too! Whether you are releasing it as an truly open-sourced software with BSD license or something else, you should mention it. If you don’t realize the importance of licensing, that is maybe because your project isn’t big enough. Once a lot of people read your code, use it, they might try to finger with it whether you like it or not. You should explicitly specify “how much fingering” you can tolerate in a separate file named as LICENCE in full detail like a legal document and if you are using a popular license, you can just mention the name in the README.\nNo place to mention about bugs You don’t have a bug management system? Okay, I agree this isn’t really always required but if you do, you should explicitly mention and link to that. If you talk about bugs in GitHub issues, then mention it there. Also if you are using GitHub, use labels to specify the bugs. If you still track bugs using emails via mailing list, specify that too also include a link to the old archives of the mailing list.\nNo mention about the version control system Well if you are seeing the project on Github, is it wrong to assume that it uses git? Yes, there are many projects that I know use multiple version control systems and the best example is nmap. They accept patches (and PRs) in all forms and integrate it together. So explicitly mention about all the version control systems that you would be using and how you would accept foreign code for each.\nNo contacts How should the viewer contact you in case he needs something or has something for you? Probably now you have a good incentive to give out your contact information (mainly email is good) for others to contact you or just say “Thanks for the awesome software!”.\nNo fancy GUI pictures You probably would have spent a hell lot of time in designing and tweaking the GUI and were frustrated when a font size looks bigger than it should, so you should show it off. There are lots of people who like the fancy GUI way of software rather than the good old black terminal with green text. If you have a fancy GUI, try and put the pictures of it in the README. GitHub’s markdown renders it, but I don’t think man pages do. But if you really care about man pages, you probably won’t even have cared enough to make a fancy GUI.\nNo table of contents Well if you try to write everything that I have pointed out, then it is probably good for you to follow this advice too. Have a Table of Contents. This way, the README will look more organized and it would make reading much easier.\nOkay, now that I have ranted a lot, I hope you know How to Write KickAss READMEs.\nThis article originally appeared in Pranit Bauva’s website.\n","date":1489429800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489429800,"objectID":"5097317266dc9d3224840b85b9208ee4","permalink":"/blog/writing-kickass-readmes/","publishdate":"2017-03-14T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/blog/writing-kickass-readmes/","section":"blog","summary":"Writing documentation for code is extremely important.

I wrote a script[1] to add infinite commits to a repository named “Commiter”[2]. It added a dot at the end of a text file after every commit. The script pushed to the master branch after every 10,000 commits and then after 1,00,000 commits it deleted the repository and then cloned it back with just the last commit. I had to do it because after a large number of commits the directory size was quite large(approx 7–9 GBs).\nWith the help of this script I was able to find three bugs on GitHub after which they blocked my repository[2] .\n Z-index for commit label of contribution graph was not proper :  Below is the screenshot of the issue I am talking about.\nIssue #1\nThe label for the commit number should be above the graph.

The reason stated by them was :\n The repository you’re inquiring about, DefCon-007/Commiter, has been deemed abusive to our system and we have disabled it.\nLarge numbers of commits do not lend themselves well to versioning with Git and performance issues with a repository of this size can endanger the availability of your repo as well as other user’s repositories. Additionally, the pattern of your commits is very different than that which Git was meant to handle, and therefore consumes far more resources than a normal Git repository of its size.\n And at the end they clearly mentioned that the repository access will not enabled again.\nP.S. : I was able to reach around 6,567,567 commits.\nSo this was my story how I used my mid semester exam frustration to do some mischief with GitHub.\nReferences :\n[1] https://github.com/DefCon-007/Commiter-source\n[2]https://github.com/DefCon-007/Commiter\nThis article is written by Ayush Goyal\n","date":1488393000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488393000,"objectID":"ec92cad9dd06a250fd9edc2c8113de15","permalink":"/blog/breaking-github-down/","publishdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/blog/breaking-github-down/","section":"blog","summary":"During my mid semester exams, one night I was getting bored so I decided to check how to break the most used code hosting website GitHub.

This particular function has to be carried out with the very high standards and utmost sincerity.\nWhy does KOSS require money? We conduct various workshops and events which require multiple costs like AV Cell booking, room booking, posters, domain hosting, servers, etc. To pay for the costs, the members had donated various sums of money to sustain the society while finding some self-funding source so as to continue the society in perpetuity without much financial strain on it’s individual members.\nWhat is that self-funding source? Currently, we conduct various workshops in an ongoing partnership with KTJ wherein they in turn, agree to donate some money to us. The money which we currently get is sufficient to continue with our expenses.\nWhat is the goal of receiving donations? To get enough money to sustain society and pay for various costs in conducting the events.\nWhat isn’t the goal of receiving donations? The money which we receive should never be used for internal parties/treats. The reason is simple: we don’t want to conduct events because we have the end goal of partying (which happens in majority places). Also, we think it’s a very healthy culture of seniors treating juniors and should continue.\nSide note: If we expect our members to stay the entire day involved in KOSS’ events, workshops, etc then of course, we have to provide food from KOSS’ accounts. Such meals shouldn’t be extravagant, but should be good enough.\nWho maintains this for KOSS?

It is a week dedicated to the Governance of KOSS.\nOur intention behind organizing the Governance Review Week is to help the core team members measure their level of involvement in KOSS. The week also promotes open discussions between Seniors and the Core team members. We want each one of our members to be frank with their batchmates as well as seniors in sharing their opinions and perspective on every aspect of KOSS.\nWe also review how KOSS performed as a team in the past year. We identify our problems and discuss solutions. We want to make sure we eliminate all forms of toxicity from KOSS (It can be habits of how we do things, or some Core Team members themselves.)\nWhat is the structure and timeline? We physically meet for 3-5 days for 3-4 hours each day. We put up few questions in advance and the Core Team Members have to think and give their answers or their take on the subject. All the second years individually speak for a few minutes. The time limit is decided and followed. We later discuss the answers given by the CTMs. The members send their answers on the Google Group thread of the day. The sessions are recorded and put up on our archives.\nWhat happens after this week? Executive Heads discuss the involvement and membership of each Core Team member. If they find someone not being a good fit to continue, this is the time when the team is updated and they are laid off (See Onboarding/Offboarding).\nAfter the week, Core Team members become the new Executive Heads and Executive Members (See Governance), quickly followed by an Introductory Seminar and the Selection of new members.\nA new version of KOSS Documentation is released. It is suggested to scrutiny everything which is written over here. Detailed changelog should be published which answers, \u0026ldquo;What changed and Why?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What things worked out really well?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;What more should be written?\u0026rdquo;, etc. Alumni of KOSS will receive the changelog via email, and it will be published in the repository as well.\nWhy do we do this?  Evaluation. We want Core team members to review their year and contributions to KOSS Executive Heads want to understand the priorities and values of the new batch. They form the questions to do so. This is a great time to know and identify potential Executive Heads on an individual level. Self-awareness of all the members. Questioning the principles of KOSS. We discuss and make serious policy changes to how things are done.

Share your “wins-list”! Here is your chance to show-off your contributions made to KOSS. Do not underestimate any kind of contribution. Be precise and exhaustive. - Question 2 (4 mins) - We at KOSS have noticed that we have a developed a toxic culture of delaying the work and tasks to the last moment. Though some tasks and timelines are planned, they are not executed properly. - What do you think is the root cause of this issue? - As an executive, what steps would you take to eliminate such a culture? - Would you prefer distributing workload with deadlines to each member or rather have a committed sense of ownership within the group and have people take tasks on their own? - Question 3 (2 mins) - Any organization is driven by a strong bonding nature between the members. - Is there a communication gap in KOSS? Mention evidence if you can recall. - Think of an idea to overcome it? - How will you increase the bonding among the new members and as well as the entire juniors and executives batch?  Day 2 - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kossiitkgp/DmO7K-CZnOQ/UTfVzASxFgAJ\n- Question 1 (4 mins) - From what you have observed in your own batch, what are the qualities/characteristics you will be looking forward from the incoming batch? How would you be the judging these criteria? - From this year we have decided to go for forms for the first round. (Similar to what GitHub and other tech companies do) - What are the questions that you would like to add there? How are you going to judge based on these questions? - What are some good red-flags would you use to remove false positives? - How would you plan the interviews and panel (size, composition)? - What should be the ideal size of the batch? - How do you present KOSS to them i.e. value they will gain from KOSS? - Any other comments on selection apart from what we discussed? - Question 2 ( 3 mins) - Why do you think these events were started in the first place? - Suggest one new event(workshop/seminar/different genre) that we should conduct in the upcoming year. - Why do you want this to be executed? - Give a brief overview of how would you go about organizing it as the Executive responsible for the event.  Day 3 - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kossiitkgp/-t4l9WdJYhs/HlS8UpzCFwAJ\n- Question 1 [3 mins] - How was your year working in KOSS? - Mention at least 3 things you learned at KOSS. - Which event(s) did you enjoy? - Think about the time when you joined KOSS. Which of your expectations have been met and which ones have not, yet? What were some of the unexpected things you overwhelmingly enjoyed, which you hadn't expected? - Question 2 [2 mins] - Mention one thing that you want to change about KOSS (be it the culture, the hierarchy structure, the management or anything that you feel will be harmful in the long run)? - Question 3 [2 mins] - Is KOSS different from other societies? Why/Why not? - How is KOSS helpful to you?

(Link to the answers/Google Group thread)\nDay 1: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kossiitkgp/WxBNzdCBb5Y/U0cCf-mTBwAJ\n- Question 1 (4 mins) - We conducted numerous flagship events/seminars during the past year, e.g., KWoC, Summit, Git workshop, Dual boot best, GSoC seminar. - Why do you think these events were started in the first place? - What order would you suggest for the organization of the Autumn Sem events? Why? - Why and how do you think new ideas come up? How would you, as an Executive, promote innovation of ideas in the team? - Suggest one new event(workshop/seminar/different genre) that we should conduct in the upcoming year. - Why do you want this to be executed? - Give a brief overview of how would you go about organizing it as the Executive responsible for the event. - Question 2 (2 mins) - At KOSS, we believe that before organizing any event, it’s important to discuss the pros and cons. The ability to listen to others and being humble about your idea is of prime importance. - We encourage people to share their passion for technologies with the team. Thus, we appreciate transcending the “senior”-”junior” hierarchies (as long as its mutually respectable) in order to share your thoughts and opinions. At the same time, it is required of every member to take ownership of their work and readily accept their mistakes. - Share an instance when you took a stance about something you are passionate about. - As a “senior”, how would you promote this culture among the team, especially the newcomers?  Day 2: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kossiitkgp/WxBNzdCBb5Y/XtzHMunyBwAJ\n- Question 1: (3 mins) - The ability to communicate clearly with the team members forms the basis of any successful organization. We created the KOSS Slack Workspace to facilitate everyone to share their opinions with others and stay connected. - What’s your take on current state of intra-group communications in KOSS (i.e. Senior - Executive, Executive - Juniors, Senior - Junior)? (1 min) - How do you communicate with others in KOSS? (20 sec each) - Batchmates - Executives - Seniors - According to you, what should one post publicly on channels and what should be discussed in private or DMs? (1 min) - Question 2: (2 mins) - Let’s now focus on our hierarchy and what should be expected of the different batches in KOSS. (30 sec each) - Ideally, what should be the role of Executive Heads? - What should be the task of Juniors/newcomers? - What should be governed by the Seniors? - How do you get the team members involved in the proceedings of KOSS? Question 3: (1 min) - Do you agree that the level of comfort between “seniors” and Executives is more than that between “juniors” and (seniors + Executives)? - If so: - Why do you think it exists? - One suggestion on how we can bridge this gap.  Day 3: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kossiitkgp/H1A5SG8RV1g/LKLGdHpACAAJ\n- Question 1: (2 mins) 1. What are the qualities and experiences do you look for while inducting first-year students? 2. What are some good red-flags would you use to remove false positives? 3. How do you present KOSS to them i.e. how would KOSS generate value for them? Mention the reasons for each of your answers. - Question 2: (2 mins) How do you plan to spend the year with them, especially the first few months? How should we increase the communication between new people and the old members? Does having a room help? What are some crucial problems and how can we solve them? One example is the inertia to join Slack. - One important note: - It's totally unethical for us to not listen to the person who is speaking, does not matter if they are our senior, batchmate or junior. If we do so, it's a waste of none other than our time. We should prioritize listening over speaking.  Day 4: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kossiitkgp/RHlFh8Cv8po/eQNh_geTBAAJ\n- Question 1: (4 mins) - How was your year working in KOSS? 1. What activities did you work on? 2. Mention at least 3 things you learned at KOSS. 3. Which event(s) did you enjoy? 4. How did you help in organizing Open Source Summit? 5. Do you think your colleagues worked more than you for KWoC/Summit? How could you have helped them? 6. Think about the time when you joined KOSS. Which of your expectations have been met and which ones have not, yet? What were some of the unexpected things you overwhelmingly enjoyed, which you hadn’t expected? - Question 2: (2 mins) - Do you think KOSS has any toxic element (event/culture/person) which you think might harm in the long run? Why do you think so? What’s your proposal to deal with it?

Rest -  Core Team Members: Freshers batch. (\u0026lt; 1 year of experience) Executive Members: Batchmates of Executive Heads. Advisors: People who have been an Executive member in the past and are still on the campus. Alumni: People who have graduated but were Executives when on campus.   Permanent membership of KOSS mandates serving one year as an Executive (either as Head or Member).\nThe Story Members join KOSS in their first year as Core Team members. They spend their time learning technologies, as well as working on raising the awareness of Open Source. At the end of their second year, they take up the role of Executive Heads and Executive Members after a rigorous Governance Review Week. The former Executive Heads and Advisors decide whether a CTM will become an Executive Head or an Executive Member. (See Onboarding/Offboarding). After serving another year, they pass on the baton to the next batch, and they become Advisors while staying on the campus. They actively take part in the discussions, events, and seminars as per their skills and expertise. They graduate to become KOSS Alumni, the role of which is undecided yet.\nThe policy of KOSS membership We recruit UG 1st years in the team, preferably after they have spent one semester on the campus. We can also recruit any 2nd year in their third semester, based on recommendations by the members.\nIn the spring semester of Core Team members, they go through a Governance week discussion and finally become the new Executives (Heads and Members). Former Executives should carefully offboard members who are not a good fit for the upcoming Executive batch. Every single individual should have a net positive impact on the team. See Onboarding/Offboarding for more detail.\nDetailed Role Descriptions 1. Executives  Members in their late second and early third year\n 1.1 Executive Heads Executive Heads are de facto managers of KOSS. They have complete authority to make decisions and take up initiatives. They manage KOSS public relations on Emails and Social Media. Executive Heads are responsible for inducting new members as well as pruning anyone’s membership as they unanimously decide. In short, Executive Heads are KOSS.\nExecutive Heads decide the timeline of KOSS. They call the full-body general meetings. Executive Heads lead all the meetings and events unless they explicitly request anyone else to do so.\nAll of KOSS meetings have to be conducted in the knowledge of an Executive Head. Executive Heads have to take steps to prevent any abuse of power or harassment.\nExecutive Heads regularly consult with the Advisors. They must do it before introducing any change with high impact.\nThey approve Pull Requests to https://github.com/kossiitkgp/accounts.\n1.2 Executive Members Executive Members do not take the lead but have experience in working with KOSS and the Executive Heads. Their primary objectives are:\n Involving Core Team members through projects/hackathons to improve their skills Supporting Executive Heads when necessary  They act as resources of KOSS. They offer their suggestions constantly throughout the year.\nThey do not make any decision for KOSS without consulting the Executive Heads, or unless told to do so.\n2. Core Team members  Members in their late first and early second year\n Core Team members always represent the next generation of KOSS and FOSS culture at IIT Kharagpur. They actively volunteer to learn and conduct events, workshops, classes, etc. CTMs also learn how to work in a team. “Community is more important than Code,” and the core team should take this seriously.\nAt the end of the session, there is a week-long discussion with the Core Team members where they put their ideas forward on topics such as ‘Events,’ ‘Community Standards,’ ‘New hires,’ ‘Meetings and Communications’, etc. After these discussions, the former Executive Heads select the new Executive Heads and Executive Members and terminate the membership of people who are not a cultural fit to work with the Executives.\n3. Advisors  Members who have been an Executive before and are still on campus. Late third year onwards.\n Advisors, in general, have more technical experience. They have seen a lot of KOSS, and the members should use their experience as a resource. They actively suggest better technologies to be used in KOSS. They also make sure the Executive Heads are not over-prioritizing anything and are relaxed. They continuously take updates from the Executive Heads about what is going in KOSS. They intervene when asked by an Executive to resolve any conflict. They can also lead meetings if Executive Heads do not object.\nOne of the Advisors acts as the Treasurer of KOSS and oversees the finances. See Accounts.\n4. Alumni “Members who have graduated from KGP”\nThe role has no formal duties, as of now.\nGuidelines Guidelines for Executive Heads -  Do not miss a meeting unless extremely required (health or out of station). Your lack of involvement will psychologically disolve your responsibilities. Schedule meetings according to the availability of all the Executive Heads. Be in sync among yourselves. Frequently meet with each other. You will build an amazing friendship with this, which will remain beyond KOSS. Respect time of your fellow Executives and Juniors. Do not slack off. Always have a lump-sum timeline for events and internal workshops for a particular semester (or year). Core Team members are an essential part of overall execution, so not having a timeline puts them at blindside, and they cannot manage their time. Your Core Team Members are your KGP juniors as well. Make sure they prioritize their mental and physical health. Follow \u0026ldquo;Survival first\u0026rdquo; rule. You need to ensure that your Core Team members have learnt enough to continue in KOSS. You can prioritize this over conducting a fancy workshop. Make sure KOSS is a sexually and emotionally non-hostile place to work. Importance of this point is definitely not determined by where it is placed. Build strong connections with your Core Team members. Have regular 1:1s. Prefer Meetings and Calls over Slack and Email. Keep your Executive Members as involved as possible.  Guidelines for Executive Members -  Give Executive Heads their freedom. Do not interrupt or hinder their momentum of doing things. Offer suggestions whenever you feel like it. Come to meetings. Build relations with Core Team Members. Be active on Slack.  Guidelines for Core Team Members -  We believe in self-motivation and a sense of ownership. Try to take initiatives and tasks on your own. Make sure you are active within the community. Reach out to your batchmates and seniors once in a while. Discuss stuff with people, or you might end up losing interest. Communication skills are vital for any line of work. Practice public speaking and teaching as often as possible. Try to get over your stage fear (if you have one). There will always be people who do certain things better than you in one or more aspect. Don’t get intimidated by this. Instead, try to get the most of out it. Knowledge-sharing is how we as individuals grow.  Guidelines for Advisors - Dear fellow advisors,\nIt’s very easy to be the grumpy old fellows pointing out mistakes in others’ work and it’s quite tempting since our brain mostly favors short-term rewards. The real challenge is to enable people to improve and change themselves as well as the organization. Hiring the right people and steering them in a good direction should be the aim of an advisor.\nWhile the Execs are mostly involved in doing a lot of ground work, advisors can really think about the overall organization and how they can improve it (since we aren’t caught up in day to day shit).\n(Bauva’s Theory) Enablers vs Disablers: Enablers are the people that enable an organization to do good while disablers are exactly the opposite. Enablers are the people who can with their energy and attitude allow more people to collaborate more productively. Enablers trust the people they recruit to do their job (this has got to do a lot with having hope and faith that we have the right strategy for recruiting since without it it’s impossible to have that confidence) and teach them. Disablers don’t trust the people they recruit and curse them for their mistakes (realize that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s more important that you learn from them). An advisor should remember that every interaction is important and after you have “enabled” someone, you have set them on a good path and vice versa.\nAdvisors should aim for being enablers in KOSS and avoid being disablers.\nWhat an advisor should aim for:\n Trust the team that you have hand-picked (the most important one) Motivate the team Create reliable systems and process (like docs or mistakes repo) that reduce systematic errors Provide valuable experiences Asking Execs the reason behind their actions and thorough cross-questioning Help people learn Set the culture Set guidelines and goals Appreciate and shower praises for the good work  It’s also important to remember how we (advisors) felt when we were in our 2nd and 3rd years. Campus life is really hard and it takes a toll on the best of us. Remember that Execs \u0026amp; CTM have their own life with their own problems which they want to solve to achieve their own goals. There are many things obvious for us right now and we know what to focus on and what to not focus on. So the next time, if some junior comes up to you and says, “Kal test/assignment/lab hai, toh kaam nahi hoga” don’t starting whining about how you didn’t give a fuck about it when you were young and wild (either they won’t care or they will mistake you for being reckless). “Humare bhi dusra kaam hota hai per phir bhi hum kaam karte hai” isn’t exactly the sentence that would motivate someone. Instead try to find a solution where you solve his/her issue along without hampering the work to be done.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d15d1dcab4bd0aebf451e20745dcbf64","permalink":"/docs/community/governance/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/docs/community/governance/","section":"docs","summary":"Governance Hierarchy  Executive Heads: The public face, managers and the decision makers.

What are the reasons? A bad influence justifies bad turn of events in the future. When they become an advisor, they will recruit similar kind of people. New Core Team Members will start following them. Hence, we can not be passive about the membership of a CTM. We have to make sure we purge any unwanted behavior in time. Hence, it is important that we keep the doors open until a CTM becomes an Executive.\n If they do not align with our vision. Read Founding Principles of KOSS. If they often do not show up in Meetings, Slack, or E-mails. If they never take ownership of KOSS.  If they repeatatively do not care about how our meetings or events happen in their absense.  If they never take leadership of KOSS. If they never take any initiatives or never took part in any initiative by one of their batchmates.  If they depend upon their batchmates all the time. If they never volunteer and take up any work by their own.  If they clearly feel or state that they do not belong here.  Note: One semester may not be enough to judge. Preferably do it after Governance Review Week.\nHow do we classify a CTM as Executive Head and Executive Member? The answer to this question should come from - the Governance doc.\nAfter the Governance Review Week, all Executives and Advisors meet and decide for each CTM. Here are some guidelines -\n Read the governance doc thoroughly and judge. An Executive Head must be self-motivated about KOSS. An Executive Head must be capable of leading a new batch of KOSS. Think about all the new Executive Heads as a group. Their should not be any friction in it. Do not select a scary low number of Heads. Keep it 3-6.

Use the weekly/bi-weekly/monthly schedule feature. Come prepared with questions to ask or points to discuss. You can create an email thread between you and your mentor and log notes after the meetups. 1:1 mentorship is voluntary. Every Executive does not need to be a mentor if they are unable to commit their time. Mentors can invite any Advisor in any meeting. 1:1s are informal and inclusive. Mentors can be changed upon request by either the mentor or the mentee.  Guidelines for the mentors  Make sure your mentee feels comfortable. Let the mentee know that 1:1s are about them. Do not repeatedly cancel scheduled 1:1s. You may be creating a lot of impact on someone\u0026rsquo;s KGP journey by taking 30 minutes out of your week.

This should be carefully re-evaluated every year. People change, along with the needs of KOSS.\n Core parameters for hiring are\n Knowledge Will to Learn Will to Teach  The parameters are given equal weight.\nScreening Round An online form is released with few questionnaires. We carefully go through their answers and invite potential candidates for a sit-in interview with the team. We do this to focus more on the interviews with the eligible candidates.\nQuestions on the form for screening round -\n Name Roll Number Email ID Phone Share with us your URLs (GitHub, portfolio, any projects, etc.) Do you have any achievements you want us to know? When did you start programming? What motivates you? Tell us your story. What are you learning these days? What other societies/clubs/fests are you a part of or you want to be? How long have you been there? What are your opinions about them? Write your skills (Languages, frameworks, design skills, etc.) Why do you want to join KOSS? What are your expectations? Enlist all of your interactions with the KOSS community over the year Any comments?  Interview Round We form a few panels consisting of 3-5 people. Each panel should have at least one advisor. The interviewers evaluate them during the conversation. If a candidate does not have any projects done so far, a task must be given to check code quality. The tasks are on spot or to be completed within 24 hours.\nPanel Discussion and the release of results We all meet a few days after the interview round and discuss each potential candidate. A Physical meeting is required before finalizing the list of new members.\nAlso see Onboarding/Offboarding\nGuidelines  Have a physical meeting to discuss the selection of freshers every year. Make sure the form reaches all the freshers. Good marketing is recommended. Make the students comfortable during the interview. Freshers can get nervous and you may not get to know them completely. For on-spot tasks, judge by their effort. Give the interviewees an experience to remember. Talk politely and be curious in them. It is important that the panelists write detailed comments for every candidate after their interview. This helps in judging them later. Do not share the Sheets (responses, interview comments, etc.) with KOSS internet accounts. Maintain them on personal accounts. There is no need to archive them. Do not share Sheets with the link (use email addresses to add collaborators). Limit possibility of the new members viewing the sheets in the future. Do not discuss selections on public channels on Slack or Google Group.  Red Flags What do we mean by Red Flags?\n If you spot a red flag, you say No at the very moment. No second thoughts or arguments. The Red flags listed below do not mean they are bad qualities as a programmer or as a human being. They only mean that the person is not a cultural fit for KOSS.\n  Mentions disinterest in Teaching. Mentions disinterest in Learning. No idea what Open Source is (little knowledge is not a red flag) Highly involved in Competitive programming (as a sport) “Let us join just another society”-kind of attitude \u0026ldquo;I want to learn coding/data\u0026rdquo;. Thinks KOSS is a society which teaches members to code. Mentions “Google Summer of Code” as the primary reason to join KOSS Member of a society/club/fest with high involvement (ACell/KTJ/SF/E-Cell)  Positive points  Participated in KWoC or Summit Follows KOSS, already in touch with any of its members Tried tools/frameworks with a mindset to explore Passion Self-confidence  Negative points  Showing off grades in PDS or CG/SG Inability to express or communicate clearly Trying to flatter by talking against Competitive Programming or praising KOSS too much. Thinks lowly / of stuff like FrontEnd Designing or designing in general.  Note: Negative points differ from Red Flags. A Red Flag is too serious to consider. However, negative points do not indicate rejecting a candidate. The interviewers need to make extra effort in understand the interviewee. They may also require extra attention from the Executives/Advisors to align with our ideologies.\nFAQs Why do we hold selections in the spring semester? JEE Students do not do serious programming before coming to KGP. Hence, we give them a semester to explore their interests as well as attend workshops/events in the Autumn semester.\nCan we recruit second-year students as well? Yes, absolutely! A few of KOSS members joined in their second year. However, it should be done as early as possible (in their Autumn semester). We should not hire second year students in their spring semester because that would create a whole lot of difference in the batch, which soon would become Executives.\nWhat is the ideal number of students to recruit? A batch with more than 15 people is hard to manage. Increasing the team size makes it difficult to have like-minded people in the entire team across all the batches. Also, we should not be doing anything which requires the involvement of more than 15 people in every batch.\nArchives 2019 Facebook post - https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/posts/2072478999495756\n2018 The selection still followed direct walk-in interviews. The interviews were conducted on two days. The number of people who showed up was large compared to the number of interviewers. The experience was tiring and very repetitive with people who did not align with our principles. It was then decided that we should not do direct walk-in interviews.\nFacebook post - https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/photos/a.551030724973932/1642194875857506/?type=3\u0026amp;theater\n2017 Facebook post - https://www.facebook.com/kossiitkgp/photos/a.551030724973932/1230476980362633/?type=3\u0026amp;theater\n2016 A single round of interviews was conducted.
